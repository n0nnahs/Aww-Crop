# Aww Crop! The garden planning app
Aww crop! is the product of the hard work from five recent graduates of a 14 week java bootcamp. We used all of the things we learned to make a fully functional and responsive webapp. 

# Description 
Aww Crop allows home gardeners to plan out their plots, save notes related to plots, generate a shopping list of seedlings based on what is planted in their garden, as well as estimate yearly yields based on how much space each crop is alloted. 

# Backend
The backend is written in Java and utilizes Spring Boot. We created a RESTful API to connect our frontend interface to our database. 

# Frontend 
The frontend is written in Vue.js and utilizes Vuex and bootstrap.
